# Overview

## What is Kassandra?

[Kassandra](https://kassandra.finance) is a protocol based upon the creation, management, and distribution of highly innovative decentralized tokenized investment funds built on the Avalanche mainet. The protocol is built by the Kassandra foundation and managed by the Kassandra DAO (decentralized autonomous organization). For more great info on the Kassandra protocol read [this article](https://kassandrafoundation.medium.com/kassandra-protocol-d9cb71c02b02).

## The DAO and KACY

The Kassandra DAO is controlled by the holders of the KACY governance token, which is used to vote on proposals for protocol updates, to manage the existing investment products, and to create new products with new management strategies. Holders of KACY must stake their KACY on the protocol in order to earn voting rights. The value of KACY is directly benefited from the success of any investments products deployed on the Kassandra Protocol. A great article on KACY can be found [here](https://kassandrafoundation.medium.com/kassandra-dao-token-8bc046d55a00)

## The Foundation

The Kassandra Foundation is the entity funded by the token sales events. The purpose of the foundation is to promote and develop Kassandra in both technological and marketing aspects, via grants and capital deployment in solid activities that can leverage the success of Kassandra.

## The Funds

The decentralized, tokenized, data-driven investment funds are the flagship of the Kassandra protocol. The Kassandra foundation is constantly working towards creating the best tools available for the creation of these funds. See some features below:

- Automatic rebalancing via arbitrage
- Access to Heimdall via API3 for weighting tokens based on social scores
- Access to Yield Yak for including and auto-compounding yield bearing assets in funds
- Creation of funds by KACY holders (in near future)
- KACY emissions earned via staking of investment fund tokens
