# Staking on Kassandra

## Getting Started

To get started you must first download [metamask](https://metamask.io/) or another supported wallet and connect to the Avalanche C chain. You can find a guide on this [here](https://docs.traderjoexyz.com/en/welcome/joes-guide-to-avalanche/metamask-tutorial).

## KACY Token

### Buying KACY

The easiest way to buy KACY is through an aggregator like 1inch to ensure you are getting the best price. See several options below: 
- [1inch](https://app.1inch.io/#/43114/unified/swap/AVAX/KACY)
- [YieldYak Yak Swap](https://yieldyak.com/swap)
- [Pangolin](https://app.pangolin.exchange/#/swap?outputCurrency=0xf32398dae246C5f672B52A54e9B413dFFcAe1A44)
- [Trader Joe](https://traderjoexyz.com/trade?outputCurrency=0xf32398dae246C5f672B52A54e9B413dFFcAe1A44#/)

:::caution
Always check your slippage and price impact when purchasing a token via a liquidity pool. 1inch will split your purchase between liquidity pools to minimize price impact and get you the best price.

### Staking KACY

In order to stake KACY just head to [Staking](https://app.kassandra.finance/farm?tab=stake) on the Kassandra protocol. You then have three staking pools to choose from explained below: 

#### Withdraw Delay
Each pool differs in withdraw delay. **The withdraw delay is the amount of time it takes to withdraw your funds once you request a withdraw**. When you request a withdraw you will need to wait the full withdraw delay time before having access to your tokens. During this period no staking rewards will be earned. 

#### Voting Power
Each pool differs in voting power. The *zero withdraw delay pool* gives you 1x votes per KACY, the *15 day withdraw delay pool* gives you 2x votes per KACY, and the *45 day withdraw delay pool* gives you 3x votes per KACY. 

#### APR
The APR (annual percentage return) for each pool is calculated based on the emissions going to each pool and the amount of KACY staked in it. The more KACY staked in a pool the lower the APR will go. The higher the emissions in a pool the higher the APR will go. The emissions to the pool are currently set by the Kassandra foundation, but will soon be set by the Kassandra DAO.

#### Emissions
The emissions going to the pools are new KACY tokens being distributed (inflation). This means the KACY being earned is also increasing the supply of KACY. So there is a negative impact on price from emissions. This can be offset by several variables such as buying pressure. It is important to understand how the emissions work before staking.

#### Yield Yak
You can also stake your KACY in the *zero withdraw pool* [here](https://yieldyak.com/farms/detail/0x23bD5CD8e62369e80EB30F6D182AD4331048a246). This will automatically compound your KACY for you. Which is why you see the reward given in APY rather than APR. You will not have any voting power if you stake here. 

#### Delegating

## Investment Funds

### Buying Investment Funds
You can buy investment funds on the [Kassandra invest page](https://app.kassandra.finance/explore). When buying an investment fund is important to understand these things:
- There is currently a 3% withdraw fee on funds
- You must pay using a token or tokens already contained in the fund
- You must pay attention to price impact. The price you pay is determined by the token you are paying with. If there is already too many of that token in the pool you will not get a good price. Check the balances in the pool prior to purchasing. If you are making a large purchase try paying with multiple tokens. 
- When withdrawing pay attention to price impact. If you withdraw all assets, instead of a single asset, you will have minimum price impact. 

### Staking Investment Funds
You can stake your investment fund once you have purchased it on [Kassandra Farm Pool](https://app.kassandra.finance/farm?tab=farm) page. By staking you will earn Kassandra emissions. If you wish to auto compound your rewards you can stake via [Yield Yak](https://yieldyak.com/farms?tab=allFarms&platform=kassandra).
