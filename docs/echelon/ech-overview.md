# What is Echelon?

## Overview

Echelon is a Cosmos and EVM compatible proof of stake (PoS) blockchain combining the best of the Cosmos capabilities with the power of the Ethereum Virtual Machine. It features a native coin ECH that is used to secure the network. What does all that mean for an end user? A whole lot. Check out a few features below:

## Features:

- Compatibility with existing Solidity contracts. Allowing developers to utilize existing code from other EVM compatible networks.
- Ability to create ERC-20 versions of native coins from Cosmos networks
- Ability to safely bridge to other Cosmos networks via the trusted IBC protocol. A direct channel is being relayed between Echelon and Osmosis.
- Ability to use the Metamask or Keplr wallet with the network.
- Usage of the trusted Tendermint Core. Providing a trusted consensus mechanism for the network and crucial compatibility with other Cosmos blockchains.
- Usage of the Cosmos SDK. The other crucial component in providing compatibility with other Cosmos blockchains. This is used by chains such as the Cosmos Hub, Osmosis, Juno, and many more.

## The ECH Coin:

The ECH coin is the native coin of the Echelon blockchain. As such is it used to secure the chain via staking. Validators (who stake ECH) and those who delegate their ECH via staking to validators can vote on governance proposals on the chain. Gas fees on the chain are paid in ECH, and ECH is commonly used to pair with other tokens in liquidity pools.
