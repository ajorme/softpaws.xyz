# Staking with Metamask

:::caution
Plan carefully when staking. It will take 21 days to unbond (unstake) your ECH if you decide to. You will receive no rewards during this time.

## Stake Using the Dapp

1. Navigate to https://app.ech.network/staking
2. Find the _Delegate_ section
3. For validator search `SoftPaws` or enter `echelonvaloper15z5dphcvgvtd9c0q7e7wau782ac0hzengnx0ug` which is the SoftPaws validator address on echelon.
4. Choose the amount of ECH you want to delegate.
5. Click Delegate

:::tip
If you would prefer to find a different validator use [Cosmos Directory](https://cosmos.directory/echelon/validators) to see a full list of validators with useful attributes. You can also use [Ping.Pub](https://ping.pub/echelon/uptime) to view the uptime of different validators.
