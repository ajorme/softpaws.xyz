## Services

SoftPaws currently offers validation and enpoint services on the Echelon network. I'm looking to expand my services. Please message me if you have an opportunity. SoftPaws is currently a one man show run by me KittyxxSoftPaws. I also am an active voter on Kassandra DAO. You can delegate your KACY to me (or other KACY holders) if you do not wish to vote on your own. I run a Twitter account where I provide ambassador services for the Echelon network (paid) and Kassandra DAO. You can find any blog posts I create on medium. 

## Mission

I am very active in the projects I am involved in. I am dedicated to growing these projects and am involved because I believe in them. I aim to provide whatever assistance I can to these projects and to help others learn about them. Feel free to reach out to me on [keybase](https://keybase.io/kittyxxsoftpaws), or find me on discord by my username _kittyxxSoftpaws#1708_ at my [server](https://discord.gg/3qamCq9dNq).
